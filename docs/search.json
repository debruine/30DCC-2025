The purpose is to help researchers assess best practices in methodology and reporting. It can also be used to make meta-scientific work scriptable and easier.\nThe package comes with a built-in dataset of 250 open-access papers from Psychological Science.\nYou can use the search_text() function to search any sentences that contain the word “badge”.\n\nCodebadges &lt;- psychsci |&gt;\n  search_text(\"badge\")\n\n\nCheck all the permutations of the badge statements.\n\nCodecount(badges, text, sort = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the relevant statements all contain the word “received”.\n\nCodebadges &lt;- psychsci |&gt;\n  search_text(\"badge\") |&gt;\n  search_text(\"received\")\n\n\n\nCodecount(badges, text, sort = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nUse grepl() to determine if these sentences contain the text “open data”, “open materials” and/or “preregistration”.\n\nCodebadges &lt;- badges |&gt;\n  mutate(data = grepl(\"open data\", text, ignore.case = TRUE),\n         materials = grepl(\"open materials\", text, ignore.case = TRUE),\n         prereg = grepl(\"preregistration\", text, ignore.case = TRUE),\n         ) |&gt;\n  select(id, data, materials, prereg)\n\n\nNow you can use the info_table() function to get information about each paper’s submission and acceptance dates. Then join this to the badge data and set NA values to FALSE.\n\nCodeall_papers &lt;- psychsci |&gt;\n  info_table(c(\"submission\")) |&gt;\n  separate(submission, c(\"received\", \"accepted\"), sep = \"; \") |&gt;\n  left_join(badges, by = \"id\") |&gt;\n  replace_na(replace = list(data = FALSE, \n                            materials = FALSE, \n                            prereg = FALSE))\n\n\nSort out the dates…\n\nCodem &lt;- gregexpr(\"\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{2}\", all_papers$received)\nall_papers$year_received &lt;- regmatches(all_papers$received, m) |&gt; \n  lapply(mdy) |&gt;\n  sapply(\\(x) ifelse(length(x), year(x), NA))\n\nm &lt;- gregexpr(\"\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{2}\", all_papers$accepted)\nall_papers$year_accepted&lt;- regmatches(all_papers$accepted, m) |&gt; \n  lapply(mdy) |&gt;\n  sapply(\\(x) ifelse(length(x), year(x), NA))\n\n\nCalculate the fraction of papers each year with open data, materials and preregistration.\n\nCodeby_year &lt;- all_papers |&gt;\n  fill(year_received, year_accepted) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(data:prereg) |&gt;\n  summarise(frac = mean(value), .by = c(year_received, name))\n\n\n\nCodefrac &lt;- c(0, 1/10, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5,  2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 9/10, 1)\nlabel &lt;- c(\"0\", \"1/10\", \"1/5\", \"1/4\", \"1/3\", \"2/5\", \"1/2\", \"3/5\", \"2/3\", \"3/4\", \"4/5\", \"9/10\", \"1\")\n\nggplot(by_year, aes(x = year_received, y = frac, colour = name)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"Year Received\", breaks = 2012:2024) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\"Fraction of Papers\", limits = c(0, 1),\n                     breaks = frac, labels = label) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\"Badge:\", values = c(\"firebrick\", \"darkgreen\", \"dodgerblue3\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Open Practice Badges\",\n       subtitle = \"250 Open Access Psychological Science Papers\") +\n  theme(legend.position = c(.2, .8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A chart showing the fraction of published papers received each year by Psychological Science, from 2012 to 2023, that have open data, open materials, or preregistration badges.
