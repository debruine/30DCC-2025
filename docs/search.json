First, though, we should check the range of fwci values to find a number we can safely convert zeroes to.\n\nmin_non0 &lt;- cites$fwci[cites$fwci &gt; 0] |&gt;\n  min(na.rm = TRUE)\n\ncites |&gt; filter(fwci &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fwci)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = \"black\", fill = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1, colour = \"red\") +\n  scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like setting 0 to 0.1 will be safe for both citation count (where non-zero values logically can’t be lower than 1) and fwci (where non-zero values are all over 0.253).\n\ncites &lt;- rowwise(cites) |&gt;\n  mutate(cited_by = max(cited_by, 0.1),\n         fwci = max(fwci, 0.1))\n\nPlot this new data and change the 0.1 labels to 0.\n\nggplot(cites, aes(x = cited_by, y = fwci)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x) +\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),\n                labels = c(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000)) +\n  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),\n                labels = c(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Interpretation\nSo now we can tell that number of citations and FWCI are positively related, but not perfectly, so what explains the disrepancy? We can look at the year of publication to see if there is a consistent relationship with time since publication.\n\nggplot(cites, aes(x = cited_by, y = fwci, colour = year)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, colour = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),\n                labels = c(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000)) +\n  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),\n                labels = c(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the more recent papers tend to be above the line, and older papers below the line.
