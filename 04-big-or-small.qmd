I am old enough to remember calculating t or F values by hand, determining the degrees of freedom, and looking up the corresponding p-value in the appendix of my stats textbooks. By necessity, you could only approximate the p-value, leading to papers full of results like "p < .05" or "p < .01".

![](images/t-dist-table.png)

But we've had the ability to calculate the exact p-value for decades now, so there is no excuse to not include it. Let's explore graphically how common the occurrence of inexact p-values is in the set of open access Psychological Science papers included in papercheck.

## Modules

Papercheck is designed to be modular, so the community can contribute checks. Use `module_list()` to see the built-in modules.

```{r}
module_list()
```

### Imprecise P-Values

The module "imprecise-p" lists instances of p-values that are not exact value or p < .001. 

```{r}
imp_p <- module_run(psychsci, "imprecise-p")

head(imp_p$table)
```

Check what sections these are in.

```{r}
count(imp_p$table, section)
```

Values in figure and table captions are probably something like "* p < .05, ** p < .01", so let's focus just on values in the results sections.

```{r}
p <- imp_p$table |>
  filter(section == "results")
```

```{r}
ggplot(p, aes(x = p_value, fill = p_comp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

### Fix x-axis

P-values in research are definitely not uniformly distributed, so let's give this a log10 scale, change the binwidth to 0.1, and dodge the bars.

```{r}
ggplot(p, aes(x = p_value, fill = p_comp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, position = position_dodge2()) +
  scale_x_log10()
```


### Impossible p-values?

OK, what is going on with the p-values over 1? You can use the `expand_text()` function to expand text to the full sentence of a selection, or add sentences before and/or after it. 

```{r}
imp_p$table |>
  filter(p_value >= 1) |>
  expand_text(psychsci) |>
  select(text, expanded)
```

It looks like these are somewhat non-standard ways of writing scientific notation (papercheck will correctly read, for example, 2.2e-16) that I'll need to update the module to detect in a later revision. Let's just exclude them for now. 


```{r}
p <- filter(p, p_value <= 1)
```


```{r}
ggplot(p, aes(x = p_value, fill = p_comp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, position = position_dodge2()) +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(.001, 1.2),
                breaks = c(.001, .01, .05, .1, .25, 1),
                labels = c(.001, .01, .05, .1, .25, 1))
```


### P > 0.25

What's going on with "p < .25"?

```{r}
p |>
  filter(p_comp == ">", p_value == 0.25) |>
  expand_text(psychsci) |>
  select(id, expanded)
```

It's not just one paper, is this a norm in some fields?

## Tidy Up

### Thresholds

Maybe some of these "p < .05" statements are about thresholds, not imprecise reporting. Let's check the full sentence for the first instance of an imprecise p-value in each paper.

```{r}
exp <- p |> expand_text(psychsci)

# get the first instance per paper
exp |> 
  slice(1, .by = id) |>
  pull(expanded)
```

It looks like values with the words "threshold" or "cutoff" or an asterisk ("*") tend to be statements about thresholds. Let's check that and then exclude them.

```{r}
search_text(exp$expanded, "threshold|cutoff|\\*") |>
  pull(text)
```

```{r}
p_better <- exp |>
  filter(!grepl("threshold|cutoff|\\*", expanded))
```

### Visuals

I think the plot looks better rotated, so I'll use `ggplot2::coord_flip()` and set the axis breaks to the most common values, plus clean up the labels.

```{r}
#| label: fig-day4
#| fig-cap: The distribution of imprecise p-values in results sections. Values with < are shown in red, and > are shown in blue. Notably there are many instances of `p < .01`, `p < .05`, and `p > .25`, with smaller peaks at `p > .05`, `p < .02` and `p < .005`.
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 8

breaks <- c(.001, .002, .005, .01, .02, .05, .1, .25, 1)
total_papers <- unique(p_better$id) |> length()

ggplot(p_better, aes(x = p_value, fill = p_comp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1,
                 position = position_dodge(width = 0.05)) +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(.001, 1.1),
                breaks = breaks,
                labels = breaks) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("firebrick", "dodgerblue"),
                    labels = c("p < less than", "p > greater than")) +
  labs(title = "The Distribution of Imprecise P-Values in Results Sections",
       subtitle = paste0(total_papers, "/", length(psychsci), 
          " Open Access Psychological Science Papers"),
       x = "P-Value (log10 scale)",
       y = "Number of P-Values",
       fill = "",
       caption = "debruine.github.io/30DCC-2025/04-big-or-small") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.75, 0.85), 
        plot.caption = element_text(color = "dodgerblue"))
```

```{r}

ggsave("images/day4.png", width = 8, height = 8, bg = "white")
