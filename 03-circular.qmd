# Circular

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
source("R/setup.R")
```

I'm struggling to think of something that uses circles, but I always like those plots where the size of a sample is represented by the size of the circle on a plot.

```{r}
library(papercheck)
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 15))
```


## OpenAlex Info

Load the OpenAlex info we downloaded yesterday.

```{r}
oa_info <- readRDS("data/oa_info.Rds")
```
